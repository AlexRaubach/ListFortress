<h1 class="text-center">Create an Interdivisional Match</h1>
<br>
<p> 
Interdivisional games are for when you have trouble scheduling games with the members of your division. <br><br>
You can only schedule games with players of other divisions that are in the same tier. <br><br>
To find a game, please join your tierâ€™s channel in slack e.g. #4_outerrim and post your request or find an active player in your tier and send a dm.
Please schedule the game before using this form to create the match.
