<h1>Create an Interdivisional Match</h1>

<p> 
You can play interdivisional games if you have trouble scheduling games with the members of your division. <br>
You can only schedule games with players of other divisions that are in the same tier. <br>
To schedule a game, please join your tierâ€™s channel in slack e.g. #4_outerrim and post your request or find an active player in your tier and send a dm.
Please schedule the game before using this form to create the match.
